Hi, my name is Shasha! People also call me Lisa. I am a PhD candidate in Economics and Finance at Bocconi University.  
<br>
  I am on the 2020/2021 job market and will be available for interviews at the EEA, CICE and ASSA meetings.
  <br>
My research interests lie in Corporate Finance, Fintech, Credit Market and Financial Economics. 

<br> 
My Job Market Paper studies the search frictions in marketplace lending and the impact of informational public goods on Fintech credit borrowers (draft <a href="https://shasha-li.github.io/content/JMP-Li.pdf">here</a>).
