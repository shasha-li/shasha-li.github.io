<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b>This paper sheds light on the search friction in the Fintech credit market, and examines the impact of public information service centers on marketplace lending outcomes. 
  From 2012, Chinese government gradually introduced private lending registration service centers (PLcentres), essentially public information service centers, in many cities. 
  Exploiting the introduction of PLcentres as a natural experiment, I apply a staggered Difference-In-Differences (DID) analysis using a novel data set from a leading 
  marketplace lending platform. To address the potential endogeneity, I use a measure of China's political cycle as instrumental variable. PLcentres boost the marketplace 
  lending. Remarkably, PLcentres help borrowers secure lower interest rates from the platform and reduce the dispersion of interest rates. The effect is mainly driven by 
  less sophisticated borrowers. The findings imply that PLcentres reduce search costs, pointing to a potentially important role of informational public goods in Fintech credit.

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>This study shows that corporate default is not trivial to the real economy. Under a Cash-
In-Advance (CIA) framework, we examine the welfare cost of default and how the
injection of cash affects welfare cost of default. Incorporating non-linear form of nonpecuniary
default penalty into a CIA model, we find that default causes around 1% loss
in consumption. The negative effects of default on welfare is significantly greater in an
economy with higher money growth rate only in the long-run but not in the short-run.</p><br>
