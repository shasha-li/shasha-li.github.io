<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b>Technology has brought numerous unsophisticated individuals to marketplaces. This paper sheds light on search frictions in a two-sided online personal loan market. Empirical evidence reveals that borrowers encounter a concave demand curve in this market. However, due to limited knowledge, borrowers fail to propose optimal interest rates near average.  Exploiting the staggered introduction of private lending registration service centers (PLcenters) in Chinese cities, I demonstrate the role of public information services in mitigating frictions and improving market outcomes. These PLcenters aim to disseminate financial knowledge and enhance transparency. Using staggered difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, I find PLcenters effectively boost marketplace lending and increase match rates. Remarkably, PLcenters help borrowers, especially those less sophisticated, propose better interest rates, leading to lower costs and reduced interest rate dispersion.  In addition, I present a directed search model to explain economic mechanisms and provide welfare implications.

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b>We investigate how optimal attention allocation of green-motivated investors changes information asymmetry in financial markets and thus affects firms' financing costs. To guide our empirical analysis, we propose a model where an investor with green taste endogenously allocates limited attention to study market-level or firm-specific fundamental shocks. We find that more green-motivated investors tend to pay more attention to green firm-level information than market-level information. Thus, higher green taste leads to less category learning behaviour. It reduces the information asymmetry of green firms, leading to lower leverage and lower cost of equity capital. Moreover, the information asymmetry of brown firms and the market increases with the green taste. Greater green attention is associated with less market efficiency. We provide empirical evidence to support our model predictions by using US data. Our paper shows how the growing demand for sustainable investing shifts investors' attention and benefits eco-friendly firms.

<br>with <a href="https://yonsei.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/kwangwon-ahn">Kwangwon Ahn</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/daeyonglee/">Daeyong Lee</a><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>This study shows that corporate default is not trivial to the real economy. Under a Cash-
In-Advance (CIA) framework, we examine the welfare cost of default and how the
injection of cash affects welfare cost of default. Incorporating non-linear form of nonpecuniary
default penalty into a CIA model, we find that default causes around 1% loss
in consumption. The negative effects of default on welfare is significantly greater in an
economy with higher money growth rate only in the long-run but not in the short-run.</p><br><br><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b> We document that online marketplace lending platforms only selectively disclose their data, which significantly reduces market efficiency. Using peer-to-peer (P2P) lending data from a leading platform in China, we observe that the platform substantially under-reports actual loan default rates by cooperating with offline sister companies and using the risk control fund. Our baseline estimations suggest that the monthly default rates are under-reported by at least 5.26 percentage points on average. The Loss Given Default (LGD)-adjusted interest rate in the online lending market is not at a market-efficient level. The behaviour of hiding default data drives the online market further away from information efficiency and lowers the quality of active borrowers. Moreover, evidence from secondary market loan trading implies hiding default rates makes the market more fragile.
