<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b>This paper sheds light on the search friction in the Fintech credit market and examines the impact of public information service on marketplace 
  lending outcomes. From 2012, the Chinese government gradually introduced private-lending registration service centers (PLcenters) in many cities to 
  disseminate information and financial knowledge. Exploiting the introduction of PLcenters as a natural experiment, I apply a staggered 
  difference-in-differences (DID) analysis using a novel data set from  a leading marketplace lending platform. To address the endogeneity, 
  I use a measure of China's political cycle as instrumental variable. I find PLcenters effectively boost the marketplace lending. Remarkably,
  PLcenters help borrowers secure lower interest rates from the platform and reduce the dispersion of interest rates. Less sophisticated borrowers
  mainly drive the effects. The findings imply PLcenters reduce search costs, pointing to a potentially important role of informational public goods in Fintech credit.

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>This study shows that corporate default is not trivial to the real economy. Under a Cash-
In-Advance (CIA) framework, we examine the welfare cost of default and how the
injection of cash affects welfare cost of default. Incorporating non-linear form of nonpecuniary
default penalty into a CIA model, we find that default causes around 1% loss
in consumption. The negative effects of default on welfare is significantly greater in an
economy with higher money growth rate only in the long-run but not in the short-run.</p><br>
