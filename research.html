<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b>This paper sheds light on the search friction in the Fintech credit market and examines the impact of public information service on marketplace 
  lending outcomes. From 2012, the Chinese government gradually introduced private-lending registration service centers (PLcenters) in many cities to 
  disseminate information and financial knowledge. Exploiting the introduction of PLcenters as a natural experiment, I apply a staggered 
  difference-in-differences (DID) analysis using a novel data set from  a leading marketplace lending platform. To address the endogeneity, 
  I use a measure of China's political cycle as instrumental variable. I find PLcenters effectively boost the marketplace lending. Remarkably,
  PLcenters help borrowers secure lower interest rates from the platform and reduce the dispersion of interest rates. Less sophisticated borrowers
  mainly drive the effects. The findings imply PLcenters reduce search costs, pointing to a potentially important role of informational public goods in Fintech credit.

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b> We investigate how the attention allocation of green-motivated investors changes information asymmetry in financial markets and 
  thus affects firms' capital structure and financing costs. To guide our empirical analysis, we propose a model where an investor with
  green taste endogenously allocates attention to market or firm-specific shocks.  We find that more green-motivated investors tend to
  give more attention to green firm-level information instead of market-level information. As a result, higher green taste leads to less category 
  learning behavior and reduces the information asymmetry. Furthermore, we find higher green taste results in lower leverage and 
  lower cost of capital of green firms.

<br>with <a href="https://yonsei.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/kwangwon-ahn">Kwangwon Ahn</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/daeyonglee/">Daeyong Lee</a><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>This study shows that corporate default is not trivial to the real economy. Under a Cash-
In-Advance (CIA) framework, we examine the welfare cost of default and how the
injection of cash affects welfare cost of default. Incorporating non-linear form of nonpecuniary
default penalty into a CIA model, we find that default causes around 1% loss
in consumption. The negative effects of default on welfare is significantly greater in an
economy with higher money growth rate only in the long-run but not in the short-run.</p><br>

<strong><a>Data Manipulation in Marketplace Lending</a></strong>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i>
  </b> We detect loan repayment performance data manipulation in online marketplace lending and explore how information manipulation affects market outcomes especially market efficiency. 
  Using a data set of peer-to-peer loans from a leading online lending platform in China, we find that the platform substantially 
  under-report the default rate by cooperating with an offline sister company. Our baseline results suggest that the monthly default
  rates are on average under-reported by 14%. The data shows that the LGD-adjusted interest rate fails to predict the default, 
  and the market is not efficient. Furthermore, hidden default data drives the online market further away from information efficiency.
  And liquidity plays an important role in the deviations of the market prices from the information-efficient level.
